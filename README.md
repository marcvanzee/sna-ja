## Experiments of Social Network Analysis for Judgment Aggregation

These are some experiments used to see whether centrality measures of social network analysis such as degree centrality can be used to decide on the outcome a voting process. The main idea is to translate a voting scenario into a social network and compute the outcome of the voting process using well-known centrality measures.

A formal correspondance between the two fields (i.e., voting and social network analysis) as well as more details on these experiments can be found in two publications:
